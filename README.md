# bridge-web-backend

This is the backend project (with AWS Lambda services) for the 2020 YC Hackathon and our project: Bridge.

Bridge is a web application that lets seniors contact their grandchildren easily, from the comfort of their bed and by using facial and gesture recognition. Think of it as the Snapchat for grandparents and grandchildren.
